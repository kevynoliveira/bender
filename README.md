## misc
A couple of things to be mindful about:
- Display gets dim (minimum brightness) at boot, goes back to normal after a few mins or sleep -> wake (doesn't happen every time but happens most of the time)
- Battery life is poor (compared to other OS's)
- Laptop gets hot easily (compared to other OS's)
